## About
After I found myself visiting the Pasco County (Florida) Property Appraiser website frequently, I decided to create an easier way to search the database. Although the standard page works fine, it does not allow certain functionality such as reviewing more than one street of results simultaneously. Additionally, I wanted something easier to read and cleaner without any of the site's other content being rendered.

This unofficial project is NOT affiliated with the Pasco County Government, Pasco County Property Appraiser, or any other entity.

A Link to the official PCPA search site is here: <a href="https://search.pascopa.com/">Pasco County Property Appraiser</a>
### All information displayed through this page is public record and openly available at the Pasco County Property Appraiser. I have no control over the removal of any content.
